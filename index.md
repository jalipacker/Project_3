# Computing in Context - Jali Packer

This microsite contains my submissions for Project 1, 2, and 3. These projects explored the following questions: 

### Project 1

Project 1 looked at daily COVID case count in New York City, from 2020 to 2024.

### Project 2

Project 2 investigated the relationship between dog licenses and dog bites in New York City, at the zip-code level. This relationship was explored both spatially and temporally, from 2015 to 2022. 

### Project 3

Project 3 investigated the impact of county-level growth rates in GDP per capita on the change in proportion of votes for Republican candidates in the U.S. 2024 General Elections.
